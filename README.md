# Car-Price-Prediction
This project involved using machine learning techniques to predict car prices. The first step was to explore and clean the data, which included feature engineering and preprocessing. Next, different linear regression models like Ridge and Lasso were built, and performance was measured using r2 score and cross-validation techniques. Additionally, advanced concepts like polynomial regression and feature scaling were applied to improve model accuracy.
